## A few words
I use github.com/google/gopacket to extract the packets from the pcap files. Once done, the function handlePacket will process it and read the payload of applicatio layer.

I had to use one global variable in order to give an ID to each S7 operations while discarding other layers (TCP, IP, MAC...) from the final output
